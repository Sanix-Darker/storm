# SToRM

Stream your local videos/films/series in a LAN network (accessible from your mobile or anyone want to watch movies saved in your computer).

## Why you need Storm

This might not be obvious at first glance, but sometimes we are in a public environment and we would like to kill time watching a movie or serie that we have in our PC without necessarily wanting to take our PC bag A the view of everyone, I created Storm to manage only this small problem, it allows you to stream your movies / series directly on all your local network (Your mobile, etc ...) so you have access to your movies , etc. without having to install any tool for the client.

## Requirements

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
